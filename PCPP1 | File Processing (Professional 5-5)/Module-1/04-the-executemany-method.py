sqlite3 â€“ the executemany() method

Performing many queries is not very efficient when we can use just one that performs the same task. Imagine a situation where you want to add three tasks to the database. If we used the execute method, we would have to do three separate queries.

This isn't good practice. Fortunately, the Cursor object offers us a method called executemany. Look at the code in the editor.

The executemany method allows you to insert multiple records at once. As an argument, it accepts an SQL statement and an array containing any number of tuples.
