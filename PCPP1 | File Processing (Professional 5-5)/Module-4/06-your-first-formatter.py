"""
Your first formatter

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve just created your first handler. Only the formatter is missing, but don't worry. It's just two steps. Take a look at the example in the editor.

Result in the prod.log file:

__main__:CRITICAL:2019-10-10 20:40:05,119:Your CRITICAL message

In the first step you need to create a Formatter object by passing the format you've defined to its constructor. In the example, we use the format defined in one of the previous examples.

The next step is to set the formatter in the handler object. This is done using the setFormatter method. After doing this, you can analyze your logs in the prod.log file.

import logging

FORMAT = '%(name)s:%(levelname)s:%(asctime)s:%(message)s'

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

handler = logging.FileHandler('prod.log', mode='w')
handler.setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)

formatter = logging.Formatter(FORMAT)
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.critical('Your CRITICAL message')
logger.error('Your ERROR message')
logger.warning('Your WARNING message')
logger.info('Your INFO message')
logger.debug('Your DEBUG message')
