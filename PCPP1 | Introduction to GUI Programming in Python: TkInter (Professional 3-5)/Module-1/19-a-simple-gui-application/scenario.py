"""
Now we invite a Button to join our team.

Our Button will be completely mute, as we havenâ€™t bound anything to its command property. You can change that if you want.

This is what our window looks like now:
"""
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

window.mainloop()
