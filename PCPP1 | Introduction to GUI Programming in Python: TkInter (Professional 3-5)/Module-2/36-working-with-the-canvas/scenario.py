"""
Drawing a polygon looks very similar to drawing a line, with the difference being that the last segment (connecting the first and the last points) in the chain is drawn automatically (you donâ€™t need to specify the same point as the first and the last (x,y) pair:

canvas.create_polygon(x0, y0, x1, y1, xn, yn, option...)

The method uses the same set of options as create_polygon().

Do you want to see it in action? Check out the code we've provided in the editor.

Analyze it and try to predict the shape it produces.
