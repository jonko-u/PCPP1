"""
Drawing an ellipse (and a circle is, in fact, a specific ellipse) needs a method named create_oval():

c.create_eclipse(x0,y0,x1,y1,xn,yn,option...)

The method draws an ellipse inscribed in a rectangle with vertices at the points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1).

If the rectangle is a square, the ellipse becomes a circle.

The options are the same as for create_polygon().

Letâ€™s test it. Run the code we've provided in the editor.

Is it an ellipse or a circle? What do you think?
