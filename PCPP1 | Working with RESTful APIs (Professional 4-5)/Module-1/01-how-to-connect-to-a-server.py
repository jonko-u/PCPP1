Connecting to a server

If we use a socket on the client's side, we are ready to make use of it. The server, however, has a few more steps to take. In general, servers are usually more complex than clients (as one server serves many clients simultaneously) - this is the moment where our telephone analogies stop working.

The configured socket (just like ours) is able to be connected to its counterpart on the server's side. Look at the code in the editor - this is how we perform the connection.

The connect() method does what it promises - it tries to connect your socket to the service of the specified address and port (service) number.

Note: we make use of the variant where the two values are passed to the method as elements of a tuple. This is why you see two pairs of parentheses there. Omitting one of them will obviously cause an error.

Note: the form of the target service address (a pair consisting of the actual address and port number) is specific for the INET domain. Don't expect it to look the same in other domains.

You may ask - why 80? Can I put something else instead of this? No, you canâ€™t. 80 is a well-known service number for HTTP. Any Internet browser will try to connect to port number 80 by default, so we do it, too.

Is it possible that the connection attempt will fail? Of course it is. There are lots of possible reasons: a malformed address of the service, a non-existent server, a connection error, and more. How we can discover such unpleasant events?

If something goes wrong, the connect() method (and any other method whose results may be unsuccessful) raises an exception. Let us postpone the issue for a moment. For the moment we can assume then everything goes smoothly.

Yes, we know. The awakening from this dream can be painful.

The connection is ready. The server has accepted our connection and is very curious about what it will hear from us. Don't let it wait too long.

But... what do we really want to tell the server anyway? How do we talk to the HTTP server to be sure that it understands us? We have to speak in HTTP, of course.
